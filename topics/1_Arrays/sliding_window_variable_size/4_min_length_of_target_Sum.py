"""
Find the min length sum array where the sum is greater than or equal to the targe
Assume all the values are positive

2 3 1 2 4 3  target 6
ans -> 2 since 2+4 - 6

"""
Approach 1 : Brute Force

-> iterate and check if the we have the target sum or great 
-> store the min length with which the target is reached
